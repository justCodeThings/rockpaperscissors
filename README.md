# Rock Paper Scissors AI
This is a machine learning AI that can play the classic game Rock Paper Scissors. Comment out the winning_cards function in order to train a super AI who can predict your every move and will then take over the world.

### Prerequisites
You will need to install sklearn and pyautogui in order to use this program.  Both libraries can be installed with pip.

### Running the AI
Clone the repo, run rockpaperscissors.py, follow the prompts.  The program will print a detailed "round report" to the console while conducting the game through pyautogui.pymsgbox prompts.
