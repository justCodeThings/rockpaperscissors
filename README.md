# Rock Paper Scissors AI
This is a machine learning AI designed to play Rock Paper Scissors with either a human in `rockpaperscissors.py` or against another AI of the same build in `machinevmachine.py`.
## Prerequisites
You will need to install `sklearn` in order to run both programs and `pyautogui` for `rockpaperscissors.py`.  Both libraries can be installed with pip.

## Running the AI
### rockpaperscissors.py
This program will guide the user with prompts when run and will display a score card after each round declaring the AI's move and the overall score.  To terminate the program, simply close the prompts.
### machinevmachine.py
This program will run py itself at break neck speeds when run as the robots duke it out.  The round number, score, moves made, and time the round took will be displayed each round.  To terminate the program, a keyboard interrupt can be used.  No official stop has been implemented.
